Book Screenshot Tool

I made this tool to help capture book pages or documents from the screen and save them into a single PDF. It's useful when materials can't be downloaded directly but you still want to print them or read offline.

Requirements
If you run from source: Python 3.x
Install dependencies: 
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you use the .exe: No installation needed (Windows only)

Option 1: Windows Executable
Download and run book_screenshot.exe
No need to install Python or packages
